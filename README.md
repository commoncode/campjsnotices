Built by Daryl Antony in a few hours for CampJS II workshop, August 2013.

Hit him up for coffee in Melbourne:

Rationale
---------

It seems, that when attending conferences, a very useful means of keeping up to date with the Conference story is to check the conference hashtag on twitter.

I thought that this might be augmented to make a place that could capture the story of the conference in a single, summarised and documented place.

The first thing accomplished is a simple Notice Board with the ability to chat realtime about the Notices.

When I get to an Internet enabled space â€“ I'll incorporate more ideas that utilise the twitter streaming API; the notices will evolve to become a kind of living storyboard of the event.

Thanks for checking this out.


More to do?
